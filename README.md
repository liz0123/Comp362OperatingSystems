# Comp 362 Operating Systems
An introductory but very intense course on the principles of operating systems. We learned about operating system structures, processes, threads, CPU scheduling, process synchronization, deadlocks and race conditions, memory management, file system interface, input/output management, and mass storage organization.

### Project 1:

Implemented a simulated file system with a simple directory structure and memory indexing policy. The system consists of 2^16 blocks of 256 bytes of memory. Within each of these blocks a single “node” may be stored.
This task defines the structure and node. Creation and deletion within this file system.

### Lab 6

### Lab 7


### Lab 6 Deadlock

Tasks in this lab focus on solving the Dining Philosophers Problem 

### Lab 5

Task 1: Exponential Averaging ( on Wikipedia it is called moving average)

Task 2: Scheduling Thread Test

*Testing three types of threads*

- HIGH_PRIORITY → RR → SCHED_RR
- MEDIUM_PRIORITY → FCFS → SCHED_FIFO
- LOW_PRIORITY → Default (other) → SCHED_OTHER

Task 3: CPU Scheduler

*Scheduled Algorithm to search at every time tick for the element to process in Queue.*
